# CIA Triad

## Overview
The CIA Triad is a fundamental model in cybersecurity that guides the development of security policies and practices. It represents the three core principles of information security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

## 1. Confidentiality
Ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals or systems.  
- Examples:
  - Password protection
  - Encryption
  - Access control lists

## 2. Integrity
Maintains the accuracy and reliability of data. Prevents unauthorized modification.  
- Examples:
  - Checksums and hash functions
  - File permissions
  - Version control systems

## 3. Availability
Ensures that information and systems are accessible when needed by authorized users.  
- Examples:
  - Regular backups
  - Redundant systems
  - DDoS protection

## Learning Context
This document is part of my academic coursework as a 2nd year Cyber Security student, summarizing the CIA Triad as a key concept in information security.
