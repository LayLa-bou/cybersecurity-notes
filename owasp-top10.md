# OWASP Top 10

## Overview
The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical web application security risks. This document summarizes the key risks for academic purposes as part of my 2nd year Cyber Security coursework.

## 1. Injection
Attacks that send untrusted data to an interpreter, such as SQL, OS, or LDAP injections.

## 2. Broken Authentication
Weak authentication and session management allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens.

## 3. Sensitive Data Exposure
Exposure of sensitive information due to weak encryption or poor handling.

## 4. XML External Entities (XXE)
Attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in XML processors, potentially leading to data disclosure or system compromise.

## 5. Broken Access Control
Failure to properly enforce restrictions on authenticated users, allowing unauthorized actions.

## 6. Security Misconfiguration
Incorrect configuration of security settings, leaving systems vulnerable.

## 7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

## 8. Insecure Deserialization
Processing untrusted data, leading to remote code execution or attacks.

## 9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
Using outdated or vulnerable libraries, frameworks, or software components.

## 10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
Lack of proper logging and monitoring, delaying the detection of attacks.

## Learning Context
This document is part of my academic coursework and notes as a 2nd year Cyber Security student. It summarizes the OWASP Top 10 risks for study and understanding of web application security.
