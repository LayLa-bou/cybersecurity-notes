# Types of Cybersecurity Attacks

## Overview
This document summarizes common types of cyber attacks studied in my 2nd year Cyber Security coursework. Understanding these attacks helps in building defenses and applying security concepts.

## 1. Malware Attacks
Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to systems.  
- Examples:
  - Virus
  - Worm
